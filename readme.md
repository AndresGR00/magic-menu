# Magic Menu 🍔

## Description 📖

Magic Menu is an application designed to simplify meal planning and save time when deciding what to cook. With Magic Menu, users can manage their own recipes, create weekly menus automatically and generate recipes randomly or with specific filters. The app is designed to make life easier for those who want to optimise their time in the kitchen, allowing them to focus more on enjoying their meals than on planning them.

## Stack 💻

Magic Menu is a full stack project developed using the **MERN** stack, which includes:

**MongoDB:** NoSQL database to store recipes, users and other related data.

**Express:** Backend framework used to manage API routes and handle server-side requests.

**React:** JavaScript library for building the user interface, making the application interactive and dynamic.

**Node.js:** Runtime environment for the backend, used to run the server and handle server-side logic.

In addition to the core technologies of the MERN stack, other key dependencies have been used to enhance the experience and development:

**Chakra UI:** React component library to create a modern, accessible and highly customisable user interface, facilitating styling and ensuring a responsive and consistent design.

**Mongoose:** ORM to interact with MongoDB in a simple way, allowing the creation of data models and schemas to manage recipes and users.

**React Router:** Used to manage navigation within the application in a fluid and efficient way.

**JWT (JSON Web Token):** For user authentication and secure session management.

This set of technologies ensures an agile, modern and secure experience for users, both in the interaction with the interface and in data management.
